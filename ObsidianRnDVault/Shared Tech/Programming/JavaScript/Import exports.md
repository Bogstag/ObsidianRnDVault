1. Utility Class Naming: The class you've written can indeed be referred to as a "Utility Class" because it provides general utilities (in this case, for object manipulation). Utility classes typically contain methods that perform common tasks and are often static (though not always).
1. Filename: The `.mjs` extension indicates that the file is an ES module. It's a standard for denoting ES module files in the Node.js ecosystem. Since you're writing ES module-style code, using the `.mjs` extension is appropriate. However, the name `Object.mjs` might be a bit too generic. It might be confused with JavaScript's built-in `Object`. Consider a more descriptive name like `ObjectUtils.mjs` or similar.
1. Converting your Class to a Module:

   Let's convert your utility class to use ES module-style exports, as described in the documentation.

   ```javascript
   // ObjectUtils.mjs

   class Utils {
   	// ... (rest of your class methods and code)
   }

   export default Utils;
   ```

   The `export default Utils;` line allows you to import the `Utils` class in another file using the default import syntax.

1. Importing Your Module in Obsidian:

   Given the documentation you've provided, you'd import your utility class in another Obsidian script like this:

   ```javascript
   const Utils = await self.require.import("vault/path/to/ObjectUtils.mjs");
   const utilsInstance = new Utils();
   ```

   Replace `"vault/path/to/ObjectUtils.mjs"` with the actual path to your module in your Obsidian vault.

1. Using the Imported Class:

   Once you've imported the class, you can use it just as you would in standard JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   const sortedObject = utilsInstance.sortObject(someObject);
   ```

1. Caching and Preloading: Since the documentation mentions that modules are cached and should not have global or side effects, it's important to ensure your utility class (or any module you write) doesn't have such effects. Your current utility class is stateless and doesn't have side effects, so it fits this guideline well.

To summarize, you'll export your class using ES module-style exports, and then you can import it in other scripts using Obsidian's `self.require.import` method. The filename `ObjectUtils.mjs` is a suggested name that describes the utility nature of the class more clearly than just `Object.mjs`.

The error you're encountering is likely due to the way asynchronous imports work in the context of defining a class. You're trying to perform an asynchronous action (importing a module) at the top level of your script, which isn't directly supported in the traditional script context.

Here's what you can do:

1. Wrap your code in an asynchronous function: Create an asynchronous function and move the import and other related code inside this function. Then call this function to execute your code.

```javascript
async function init() {
	const ObjectUtils = await self.require.import(
		"System/scripts/UtilityClasses/ObjectUtils.mjs"
	);
	const utilsInstance = new ObjectUtils();

	// Your class or any other code can go here
	class VaultPlugins {
		// … rest of the class
	}

	// If you want to use the class right away, you can do so here
	const vpInstance = new VaultPlugins();
	// … rest of your logic
}

// Call the function to initialize everything
init();
```

1. Keep Utility Imports in Functions: If you plan to use the utility functions only in specific methods of your `VaultPlugins` class, you can import them within those methods. This way, you keep the import logic localized to where it's needed.

```javascript
class VaultPlugins {
	async someMethod() {
		const ObjectUtils = await self.require.import(
			"System/scripts/UtilityClasses/ObjectUtils.mjs"
		);
		const utilsInstance = new ObjectUtils();

		// Use utilsInstance within this method
	}

	// … rest of the class
}
```

The first approach is more general and will work for most cases. The second approach is useful if you only need the utility functions in specific methods and not throughout the entire class.

In the context of dynamically importing ES modules in environments that might not natively support ES module syntax, the steps you're taking are quite common. However, let's break it down:

1. Importing the Module:

   ```javascript
   const utilsClass = await self.require.import(
   	"System/scripts/UtilityClasses/ObjectUtils.mjs"
   );
   ```

   This line is required because you're asynchronously loading the module. The `self.require.import` is a custom import mechanism provided by the environment you're in (Obsidian in this case), and it's likely a promise-based mechanism to load modules dynamically.

1. Accessing the Default Export:

   ```javascript
   const ObjectUtils = utilsClass.default;
   ```

   ES modules have named exports and a default export. When you use dynamic imports, the imported module is represented as an object where named exports are properties of that object and the default export is available under the `.default` property. So, this line is extracting the default export (your `ObjectUtils` class) from the module.

1. Instantiation:

   ```javascript
   const utilsInstance = new ObjectUtils();
   ```

   This is the line where you're creating a new instance of the `ObjectUtils` class, allowing you to use its methods.

If you find this pattern repetitive and expect to use it frequently, you could abstract it into a utility function. For example:

```javascript
async function loadModule(path) {
	const moduleImport = await self.require.import(path);
	if (moduleImport && moduleImport.default) {
		return new moduleImport.default();
	}
	throw new Error("Default export not found in module");
}

// Usage
const utilsInstance = await loadModule(
	"System/scripts/UtilityClasses/ObjectUtils.mjs"
);
```

This function will import the module from the provided path, instantiate the default export, and return the instance. It simplifies the process but assumes that you always want to instantiate the default export from the module. If that's a common pattern for you, this abstraction might be helpful.
