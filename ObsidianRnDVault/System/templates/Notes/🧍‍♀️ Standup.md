## 🧐 Preparation

Highest priority first. What should we do to finish the story/epic?

Assist:
- Can you use any <u>help</u>, and from who?
- Where are you <u>stuck</u>?
- What do you <u>need</u> to finish this task?
- What is the <u>outcome</u> you're looking for?
- What needs <u>feedback</u>?
- Are you working on anything that <u>wasn't planned</u>?
- ⚠️ Mention the issue, but do not dive into details

Wrap up:
- Who has a <u>win</u> they want to share?
- What would make you feel <u>accomplished</u> today?
