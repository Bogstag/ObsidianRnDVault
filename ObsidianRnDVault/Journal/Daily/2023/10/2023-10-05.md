## ✍️

- Resources Category: Represents areas of interest that don't require ongoing responsibilities. It can be a mix of resources you've created or gathered. This category acts more as a repository of knowledge across various subjects.
- Archives Category: It seems this category is meant for storing content from the other categories once they are no longer active or relevant.

Feedback and Suggestions (continued):

1. Resources Category:
   - This category is clear in its purpose: a repository of accumulated knowledge and resources. 
   - As with the "Life" category, consider structuring the resources for better organization. This could involve subdividing by type (e.g., articles, videos, personal notes) or by topic (e.g., graphic design, web design).
   - You mentioned the possibility of sharing these resources. Ensure you're mindful of copyright restrictions if sharing externally.

2. Archives Category:
   - The concept of an archive is important to ensure your active notes remain relevant and decluttered.
   - Consider implementing a regular review process, where you move notes from active categories to the archive when they're no longer relevant.
   - If you're using a digital system, tags or a brief note about why something was archived can be helpful for future reference.
