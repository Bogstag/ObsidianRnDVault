## ✍️

Summary (continued):
- Life Category: Represents the active and current projects or tasks you are working on. It's the most actionable area and is where most time will likely be spent.
- Responsibilities/Demands Category: This category seems to represent ongoing responsibilities and roles in one's life that don't necessarily have an end date. It contains information and notes written for personal reference about these responsibilities.

Feedback and Suggestions (continued):

1. Life Category:
   - This category is clear in its intent: It's about current actionable items or projects. 
   - Consider creating a template or structure for each project within this category. For instance, every project could have a goal, a list of tasks, deadlines, resources needed, etc.
   - Given its actionable nature, incorporating a method to prioritize items can be beneficial. This could be based on urgency, importance, or both.

2. Responsibilities/Demands Category:
   - The name "Responsibilities/Demands" might be a bit long. Consider shortening it to just "Responsibilities" or another term that encapsulates both ideas.
   - It's a valuable category, especially for long-term roles and commitments. It could benefit from further subdivision or tags, like "Personal," "Work," "Family," etc., to quickly identify the type of responsibility.
   - Given that these are ongoing responsibilities, consider incorporating a method to regularly review and update this section. This way, you can ensure you're meeting your obligations and can adjust as responsibilities evolve.

3. Visibility & Accessibility:
   - If you're using a digital platform like Obsidian (as the mention of a folder suggests), consider leveraging linking between notes. For instance, a responsibility might be linked to a current project in the "Life" category.
   - Regularly archiving completed projects or tasks from the "Life" category can help keep it clean and focused.

4. Privacy & Sensitivity:
   - The note about "Responsibilities contain information you wrote for _yourself only_" suggests that some notes might be private or sensitive. If you're using a digital system, ensure it's secure, especially if it's cloud-based.
