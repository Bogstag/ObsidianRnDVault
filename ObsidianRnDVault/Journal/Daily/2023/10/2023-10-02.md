## ✍️

5. Visual Representations: 
   - It seems you've included an image or visual representation (based on the `![[3-BASB_Illos_Gray_211015_PARA-1024x537.webp|400]]` notation). Visuals can be a great way to understand and remember the system, especially if they're intuitive and well-designed.

6. Expand on Definitions:
   - It would be beneficial to provide a bit more detail on the remaining categories, especially "Responsibilities" and "Resources". How do they differ? What types of notes or tasks would fit into each?

7. Implementation & Workflow:
   - Consider outlining a workflow or process for how one would go about using this system on a day-to-day basis. How does one decide which category a new note goes into? Is there a review process? How does one migrate notes from one category to another?

8. Usability:
   - Think about the user experience. How easy is it for someone (including yourself) to quickly grasp and use the system? Is there a learning curve? Can it be simplified without losing its essence?
