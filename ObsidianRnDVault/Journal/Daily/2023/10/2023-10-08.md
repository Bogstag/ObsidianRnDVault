## ✍️

- Archives Category (continued): This category is for items that are no longer in use or relevant. However, they might be revisited in the future if circumstances change.
- Setup Section: This section describes the initial setup process for your system, suggesting the creation of root folders for each category.

Feedback and Suggestions (continued):

1. Archives Category (continued):
   - Your example of pet notes based on apartment size is a clear illustration of how items can transition between active use and archival. It's a good reminder that the value of archived notes isn't lost; they're just dormant.
   - A possible enhancement is to timestamp items when they move to the archive. This provides context on when it was deemed less relevant, which can be helpful in future reviews.

2. Setup Section:
   - This section provides clear instructions on setting up the system. For those transitioning from another system or starting fresh, these guidelines are crucial.
   - If this system is digital (e.g., using software like Obsidian), consider incorporating screenshots or visual guides to make the setup process more user-friendly.
   - Consider adding a section on migrating notes from other systems. Users might have notes in various places (physical notebooks, other apps, etc.), and a guide on integrating them can be beneficial.
