## ✍️

1. Naming & Acronyms: The E.L.R.R.A.(M+) acronym is a bit challenging to remember and articulate. While it's essential to create a system that resonates with you, consider a name that is more intuitive for others if you plan to share or recommend it.

2. Ego Category:
   - It's an interesting approach to have a category dedicated to self-reflection and understanding. It seems to act as a personal journal or diary.
   - The name "Ego" might carry certain connotations for some people, so ensure you're comfortable with that. An alternative could be "Self" or "Inner Life".

3. Life Category: 
   - The brief description suggests it's about the actions and efforts of the "Ego". It might be beneficial to delineate this more clearly. What types of notes, tasks, or thoughts would be categorized under "Life" that wouldn't fit under "Ego" or "Responsibilities"?

4. Meta Folder: 
   - It's not entirely clear from the excerpt what the purpose of the Meta folder is. If it's for system settings or configurations, maybe "Settings" or "Config" would be more straightforward.

let pages = dv.pages('"Journal"');

dv.taskList(
	pages
	.where(p => (dv.date(p.file.name) <= dv.date(dv.current().file.name) + dv.duration('3 days')) && !dv.equal(dv.date(p.file.name),dv.date(dv.current().file.name)))
	.sort(p => p.file.name, 'asc')
	.file
	.tasks
